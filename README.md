This bash script will help you to hack remote hosts 
The goal of this project is to implement all hacking tools for a complete environment.
Transform your distro in a PenTest OS with the most complete script for hacking.

## Note:
1. you will use hacking tools, so you have got to consider them untrusted; be careful using them!
