# linuxallremote
This bash script will help you to hack remote hosts 
The goal of this project is to implement all hacking tools for a complete environment.
Transform your distro in a PenTest OS with the most complete script for hacking.


## Installation of Dependencies:
to improve the expenrience and use many features, you jave got to install some third party tools
COPY and PASTE this line
```
sudo apt install -y lynx tput git strace ltrace hydra nmblookup rlogin docker john gzip bettercap & gem install mdless
```

## Use:
You can choose between two versions:
- linuxallremote.sh, the classic version without global variables;
```
chmod +x ./linuxallremote.sh && ./linuxallremote.sh
```
- linuxallremotev2.sh, an advanced version with global variables inside (automatic choice of target PORT,IP,URL, your IP,PORT, WORDLIST and more);
```
chmod +x ./linuxallremotev2.sh && ./linuxallremotev2.sh
```
