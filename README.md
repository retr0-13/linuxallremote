# linuxallremote
This bash script will help you to hack remote hosts 
The goal of this project is to implement all hacking tools for a complete environment.
Transform your distro in a PenTest OS with the most complete script for hacking.

## Note:
1. you will use hacking tools, so you have got to consider them untrusted; be careful using them!
2. this is NOT an automatic transformation pack, does not auto install any tool without your approvation;

Over 1000 tools and utilities:
- download or clone other frameworks;
- remote hack tools and exploits;
- attack protocols;
- dumping credentials and packets;
- evasion and tunneling;
- port forwarding;
- Reverse Engineering;
- attack other OS, Android too;
- Forensics and Anti-Forensics tools;
- cracking, guessing and brute-forcing passwords;
- install all hacking tools in Android Termux too;
- download hacking APKs for Android rooted devices;
- manual python and ruby hacking packages install by pip, pip3 and gem;

and much more...

Please, share and starring my repos, follow me and... Happy hacking!
